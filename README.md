# I still don't care about cookies

## Why fork?

This extension has been acquired by _**[Avast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avast)**_ (which itself has been acquired by _[Gen Digital Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_Digital)_, a large tech conglomerate) and I simply don't trust Avast with my data. Additionally, having it on GitHub allows us to improve the code and add support for websites faster.

## Contributing to Translation

We welcome contributions to the translation of the extension. If you're interested in helping us translate the extension to your language, you can join us on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/i-still-dont-care-about-cookie/).

## Contributing to The API

This extension sends requests to an API hosted at _[api.istilldontcareaboutcookies.com](https://api.istilldontcareaboutcookies.com)_ - while this is a backend-facing piece of software, the source code is available [here on GitHub](https://github.com/OhMyGuus/I-Still-Dont-Care-About-Cookies-Api) and uses the C# ASP.NET library for an MVC structure.

## License

This fork is based on [**v3.4.3**](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/i-dont-care-about-cookies/versions/) of the extension, which has been distributed under the GPLv3 (GNU) license.
