# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** November 3, 2025

## Purpose

This extension automatically hides or dismisses cookie consent banners on websites, improving your browsing experience.

## Data Collection

We value your privacy and collect as little data as possible.

- **Normal Usage:**
  During normal use of the extension, we do **not** collect, store, or share any personal or identifiable information. All processing occurs locally within your browser.

- **When Using the “Report" Functionality:**
  In that case, the extension collects and stores only the following minimal, non-personal data:
  - The **hostname** of the website you reported
  - The **browser used** (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
  - The **version number** of the extension
  - **Any notes you voluntarily provide** when submitting the report

  This information helps us diagnose compatibility issues, improve site handling, and better understand user feedback.
  No other data — such as your IP address, browsing history, or personal identifiers — is collected or stored.

## Data Storage and Retention

Reports submitted through the “Report” feature are stored publicly as GitHub issues or comments within our official repository. Please note that any information you include in your report (such as notes or descriptions) will become publicly visible once published on GitHub.

If you wish to have a report or specific information within it removed or redacted, you may contact us using the details provided below. Upon receiving a valid request, we will make reasonable efforts to delete or anonymize the relevant data.

We do not sell, share, or otherwise disclose reported information to third parties for marketing, analytics, or any other unrelated purposes.

## Permissions

The permissions requested by this extension are used solely for its intended functionality (e.g., hiding or removing cookie banners).
These permissions do **not** grant access to personal data or browsing activity beyond what is necessary for operation.

## Third-Party Access

This extension does **not** use analytics, tracking scripts, advertising services, or any other third-party integrations.

## Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect any data collected through the “Report feature from unauthorized access or disclosure.

## Children’s Privacy

The extension does not knowingly collect or store any data related to minors.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect improvements or regulatory requirements. Updates will be posted on the Chrome Web Store listing page and/or our official website.
